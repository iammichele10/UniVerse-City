# The Young Voice — Student Blog

A complete Next.js (App Router) + Firebase project: a public blog with
sections, and a Google-auth-gated admin panel for a single admin.
Post images are hosted on Cloudinary (free tier, no card required) —
Firebase Storage is not used, since it now requires a paid Blaze plan.

## Setup

1. **Open this folder in Terminal** — you don't need `create-next-app`,
   this zip already is the project.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a Firebase project** at console.firebase.google.com:
   - Enable **Authentication → Google** sign-in provider
   - Enable **Firestore Database** (Storage is not needed)
   - Click the web icon (</>) to register a web app and copy its config

4. **Create a free Cloudinary account** at cloudinary.com (no card needed):
   - Your **Cloud Name** is shown on your dashboard homepage
   - Go to **Settings → Upload → Upload presets → Add upload preset**
   - Set **Signing Mode** to **Unsigned**, save, and copy its name

5. **Set up your environment file:**
   ```
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   Paste your Firebase config values and your Cloudinary cloud name +
   upload preset name into `.env.local`.

6. **Whitelist yourself as the only admin:** in the Firestore console,
   create a collection named `admins`, and add a document whose ID is
   your exact Google account email (e.g. `you@gmail.com`). Any field
   inside it is fine — its existence is what grants access.

7. **Deploy the Firestore security rules and indexes** (requires the Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`):
   ```
   firebase login
   firebase init firestore   # point it at this project, keep default rules/indexes file names
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
   ```
   The indexes matter here, not just the rules: the public queries in
   `lib/posts.ts` filter on `status` + `publishAt` (and `category` or
   `slug`) together, which Firestore can't run without a matching
   composite index. `firestore.indexes.json` in this repo defines the
   ones it needs — if you skip deploying them, reads will fail with a
   `failed-precondition` error asking you to build the index (the error
   includes a direct console link if you'd rather create it that way).

8. **Run it:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the public site, and
   `http://localhost:3000/admin/login` to sign in and manage posts.

## What's included
- `firestore.rules` — locks writes to whitelisted admins only
- `lib/types.ts` — Post / MediaItem / SiteSettings data model
- `lib/firebase.ts` — Firebase client init (Firestore + Auth only)
- `lib/cloudinary.ts` — unsigned image upload to Cloudinary
- `lib/posts.ts` — Firestore CRUD + category-filtered queries
- `lib/settings.ts` — read/write the single site-settings document
- `lib/adminAuth.ts` — Google sign-in + admin whitelist check
- `lib/Masthead.tsx` — shared header reading from Settings
- `app/page.tsx`, `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/category/[slug]/page.tsx` — public site
- `app/admin/*` — login, dashboard, post editor (Tiptap), settings page
- `app/api/revalidate/route.ts` — on-demand cache refresh on publish

## Next steps worth doing
- Add a Cloud Function if you want scheduled posts to flip to `published`
  server-side exactly on time (current setup checks `publishAt <= now` at
  read time, which needs no extra infra and works fine for a blog).
- Build a media library screen listing everything uploaded to your
  Cloudinary account (their Admin API supports this) — right now uploads
  happen inline per-post only.
